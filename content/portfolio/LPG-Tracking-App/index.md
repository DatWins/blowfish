## App Features

- **List of Orders and Scheduling**: This feature is used to manage all orders related to the outlet and delivery scheduling. It serves as the main control hub to ensure that all orders are properly organized and managed.

- **Generated Order ID Notification**: Every time a new Order ID is created, users will receive a notification. This ensures that users are always updated about the status of new orders registered in the system.

- **View Order and Scheduling Details**: This feature allows users to view specific details of each order and its associated schedule. It includes information such as ordered items, delivery schedule, and other relevant details.

- **Search**: The search feature makes it easy for users to quickly find specific orders or schedules. Users can input keywords or other criteria to filter the required data.

- **Order Filter**: In addition to the search feature, users can use the filter feature to narrow down the order list based on certain criteria, such as status, date, or order type.

- **Delivery Confirmation (Yes or No)**: This feature allows the transporter to confirm whether the delivery has been completed or not. This is a crucial step to ensure that the delivery process is completed and properly recorded in the system.

- **Delivery Notification**: Once the delivery is completed, this feature will send a notification to the relevant users. This ensures that the goods have been delivered as ordered.

- **Goods Received Notification at the Outlet (Agent)**: This feature informs the agent or outlet that the delivered goods have been received. This helps reduce confusion or uncertainty about the delivery status.
