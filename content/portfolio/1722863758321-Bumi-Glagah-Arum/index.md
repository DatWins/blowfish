[Bumi Glagah Arum](https://bumiglagaharum.com/) is an ideal place to unwind from the hustle and bustle of the city. Enjoy the serene atmosphere with your family, partner, colleagues, or alone for reflection and inspiration.
With the breathtaking view of Gunung Semeru and the cool air, Bumi Glagah Arum combines natural beauty and luxury. The site offers glamping with tents for 2 to 4 people, as well as various facilities, including a food court, children's play area, and exciting outdoor activities.

I have contributed to the development of a mobile application for Bumi Glagah Arum, starting from designing the concept, structuring the app flow, creating the UI/UX design, and ensuring the app functions properly.

This application is designed to enhance the user experience at the tourist location with key features catering to different types of users:
1. Shop Owners in Food Court
      - Create and manage products, view sales results, receive and update order status, and print invoices using Bluetooth.
Manage and update inventory, track sales, and handle customer orders.

1. Waiters
      - View order status by table, create and manage orders, and handle draft orders.

2. Regular Users / Visitors
      - Rent glamping, tents, camping equipment, outdoor facilities, and designated areas.


## Achievement

The Bumi Glagah Arum app has been downloaded by more than 1,000 users on the Play Store and has successfully streamlined the service process at the tourist site.
