## ❤️ About Me
Hello 👋 , I’m **Utrodus Said Al Baqi**. As a software engineer, I am proficient in **Dart** and highly skilled in the **Flutter framework**. I specialize in developing beautiful, user-friendly multiplatform applications for **Android, iOS, and the Web**. My unique blend of technical expertise and design skills ensures that every project is both functional and visually stunning.

I prefer to work **remotely** 👨‍💻 rather than commuting to an office. Therefore, I will continue working remotely, whether **full-time** or **freelancing**.

## 👨‍🚀 My Journey

- 🔭 Currently engaged in Multiplatform App Development, I am working on projects that span Android, iOS, and Web.  
- 🌱 My ongoing learning journey includes delving deeper into Dart for backend and Laravel. 🤓 I have a penchant for conducting mini-research or investigations into things that pique my curiosity, especially within the realm of Multiplatform App Development.  
- 🗿 Fun Fact: As an early adopter of Flutter, I have been exploring its capabilities for over three years.
