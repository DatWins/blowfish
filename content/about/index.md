Hello 👋 , I’m **Utrodus Said Al Baqi**. As a software engineer, I am proficient in **Dart** and **Flutter**, Specializing in developing beautiful, user-friendly apps for **Android, iOS, and the Web**. My unique blend of technical expertise and design skills ensures that every project is both functional and visually stunning.

Originally from **Blitar, Indonesia**, where I currently reside, I prefer **working remotely** 👨‍💻 rather than commuting to an office. Therefore, I will continue working remotely, whether on a **full-time** or **freelance basis**.


I am a hardworking individual with a strong drive to achieve my goals. My curiosity, especially about **technology**, is high, and when I'm intrigued by something, I usually dive into **research and experimentation**. 

I also tend to be a **perfectionist**, which has its pros and cons. To manage my perfectionism, I focus on completing tasks first and address any issues that arise along the way.
