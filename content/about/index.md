## A Bit About Me!

Hello there! üëã **I‚Äôm Utrodus Said Al Baqi**, a software engineer with a passion for building beautiful, user-friendly applications using **Dart** and **Flutter**. 

Whether it‚Äôs for Android, iOS, or the web, I focus on creating apps that not only look great but also **make life easier for users**.

> Every project I take on is an **opportunity** to create technology that makes a **positive impact**, blending technical skill with thoughtful design to deliver something both **functional** and **visually stunning**.

Originally from **Blitar, Indonesia**, I currently **work remotely** üë®‚Äçüíª. This setup gives me the flexibility to deliver high-quality results, whether for **full-time** roles or **freelance** projects.

I‚Äôm **hardworking**, **goal-driven**, and always **curious** about new technology. I love diving into research and experimentation when something catches my interest, constantly learning and growing along the way.

Though I tend to be a bit of a **perfectionist**, I‚Äôve found a balance by focusing on getting things done first and fine-tuning as needed.
