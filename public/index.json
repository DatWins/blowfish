The client for this project is Mohammad Nadzif - PT MyPro Solusindo Informatika, acting as a vendor for Pertamina Patra Niaga. In this project, PT MyPro Solusindo Informatika was responsible for providing technology solutions to improve efficiency and transparency in LPG tracking and delivery.\nI worked as a freelancer for PT MyPro Solusindo Informatika, acting as the lead developer for designing the UI/UX and developing the mobile application.\nThe application is designed for two primary user roles:\nTransporter (🚚) Outlet (📦) With comprehensive features, this application facilitates the management and tracking of LPG distribution processes, from order management to goods receipt confirmation.\nScope of Responsibilities # Creating UI/UX Design using Figma according to the client\u0026rsquo;s request. Developing standardization for code and Flutter project. Developing the application to completion. This includes translating the designed UI, integrating it with the backend, implementing refresh token, and applying Flutter best practices. Screenshots # App Features # List of Orders and Scheduling: This feature is used to manage all orders related to the outlet and delivery scheduling. It serves as the main control hub to ensure that all orders are properly organized and managed.\nGenerated Order ID Notification: Every time a new Order ID is created, users will receive a notification. This ensures that users are always updated about the status of new orders registered in the system.\nView Order and Scheduling Details: This feature allows users to view specific details of each order and its associated schedule. It includes information such as ordered items, delivery schedule, and other relevant details.\nSearch: The search feature makes it easy for users to quickly find specific orders or schedules. Users can input keywords or other criteria to filter the required data.\nOrder Filter: In addition to the search feature, users can use the filter feature to narrow down the order list based on certain criteria, such as status, date, or order type.\nDelivery Confirmation (Yes or No): This feature allows the transporter to confirm whether the delivery has been completed or not. This is a crucial step to ensure that the delivery process is completed and properly recorded in the system.\nDelivery Notification: Once the delivery is completed, this feature will send a notification to the relevant users. This ensures that the goods have been delivered as ordered.\nGoods Received Notification at the Outlet (Agent): This feature informs the agent or outlet that the delivered goods have been received. This helps reduce confusion or uncertainty about the delivery status.\nUpdate Delivery Status: Users can update the delivery status through this feature. This ensures that the most up-to-date information about deliveries is always available in the application.\nGoods Receipt Confirmation: This feature allows the outlet to confirm that the goods they received match the ones shipped. It is an important step in accurately recording the receipt of goods.\nDelivery Realization Confirmation (Yes or No): This feature allows users to confirm whether the delivery realization has been completed or not, providing additional assurance in the tracking process.\nInput Delivery Realization: Users can input delivery realization data through this feature, recording the details of completed deliveries for administrative and reporting purposes.\nPhoto Upload: This feature allows users to upload photos as proof of delivery. It can be used to document the condition of goods during shipment or receipt, adding a layer of security and verification.\nGeo-Tagging Location Validation: This feature is used to validate the geographical location (geo-tagging) when goods are delivered.

These steps include:\nCase Folding: This stage converts all characters in the text to lowercase and removes punctuation marks, ensuring uniformity in the text processing.\nTokenization: The text is broken down into smaller parts known as tokens or words, which are then individually processed.\nStopword Removal: Commonly used words that do not contribute significant meaning to the search, such as prepositions and conjunctions, are removed to focus on the most relevant terms.\nStemming: Words are reduced to their root form according to the morphological structure of the Indonesian language. This involves removing all affixes, such as prefixes, infixes, suffixes, and confixes, ensuring that the search considers the base meaning of the words.\nSimilarity Measurements\nLexical Similarity Measurement: The app uses Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and Cosine Similarity to measure lexical similarity. TF-IDF evaluates the importance of a word in a document relative to the entire dataset, while Cosine Similarity calculates the cosine of the angle between two vectors (representing documents or queries) to determine their similarity based on word occurrence.\nSemantic Similarity Measurement: To capture semantic meaning, the app employs word embeddings using the FastText model. This approach allows the app to understand and measure the similarity in meaning between words, even if they are not lexically identical, by representing words in a continuous vector space.\nScreenshots # Mobile App # Web App # API Documentation # Preview # Mobile App # Web App # App Features: # Advanced Qur\u0026rsquo;anic Text Search # The app allows users to search for Qur\u0026rsquo;anic verses in Indonesian translations using both lexical and semantic similarity, helping users find the most relevant verses based on keywords or meaning.\nLexical Search # The app features a search capability that leverages lexical similarity, ensuring that verses with similar keywords are accurately identified and presented to the user.\nSemantic Search # The search feature goes beyond keyword matching by understanding semantic meaning, enabling deeper and more relevant searches.\nIntegrated REST API # The app is integrated with a REST API developed using FastAPI Ayatnesia for managing Qur\u0026rsquo;anic data, ensuring fast and efficient search performance.\nReliable Data Source # Utilizing the Qur\u0026rsquo;an dataset from the Indonesian Ministry of Religious Affairs (Kemenag), including Arabic text, Indonesian translations, and brief interpretations, guarantees data accuracy and reliability.\nLink to Project # Mobile App # utrodus/flutter-ayatnesia-quran-search Mobile app developed using Flutter as a final year project for the Computer Science program at Nahdlatul Ulama University of Blitar.
