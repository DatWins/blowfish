I recently migrated my portfolio site from Gridsome to Hugo, a decision driven by both practical and technical needs.\nOriginally, my site was built with Gridsome, a Vue.js-powered static site generator. It served me well for showcasing my projects, but as my portfolio grew and I wanted to add a blog, maintaining the Gridsome project became increasingly cumbersome.\nThis is my old portfolio site built with gridsome:\nHere, I‚Äôll break down why I chose Hugo, how I managed the migration, and why Hugo offers a superior solution for developers seeking performance, simplicity, and scalability.\nWhy Move Away from Gridsome? # Gridsome is an excellent tool for static sites, especially if you\u0026rsquo;re already familiar with the Vue.js ecosystem. However, as I expanded my portfolio site to include a blog, I encountered several limitations:\nComplexity: Managing content became increasingly challenging, particularly for creating blog posts. The Vue-based architecture meant that even minor content updates often required codebase changes, complicating what should be a simple task.\nPerformance: While Gridsome is relatively fast, as the project grew, so did the build times. I wanted a static site generator that could handle larger content scales with improved speed and efficiency.\nMaintenance: Keeping up with Gridsome\u0026rsquo;s dependencies and structure demanded more attention than I anticipated. This led me to seek a solution that was easier to maintain.\nWhy Hugo? # After exploring various static site generators, such as Jekyll, Gatsby, and Hugo, it became clear that Hugo was the best option for my needs. Here\u0026rsquo;s why:\nUnmatched Speed: Hugo is written in Go, making it one of the fastest static site generators. Build times, even with numerous pages and blog posts, are practically instantaneous.\nSimple Content Management: Hugo handles content through simple Markdown files. I no longer need to wrestle with complex Vue.js components or GraphQL queries just to write a blog post.\nEase of Maintenance: With Hugo, maintenance is drastically reduced. It doesn‚Äôt have nearly as many dependencies, making it far easier to manage in the long run.\nBlowfish Theme: I discovered the Blowfish theme by Nuno Cora√ß√£o, which fits my needs perfectly. Its minimalist design and developer-friendly features make it ideal for showcasing a portfolio and managing blog content.\nMigration Process: From Gridsome to Hugo # Migrating my portfolio from Gridsome to Hugo involved several key steps:\n1. Content Migration: # Hugo uses a folder-based content organization. This meant that I needed to convert my existing content into Markdown files and add appropriate front matter. This process was straightforward compared to the more complex data-fetching logic in Gridsome.\n2. Templates and Layouts: # Hugo‚Äôs templating system is built on Go templates, which are simple yet powerful. Unlike Gridsome‚Äôs Vue components, Hugo allows you to manage layouts through plain HTML files, offering greater flexibility without needing to manage JavaScript-heavy dependencies.\n3. Deployment: # I host my portfolio on Netlify, automating my build and deployment process was incredibly simple. Every time I push changes to the main branch, Hugo builds the site, and Netlify handles the rest.\nWhy Blowfish? # The Blowfish theme was a key factor in my switch to Hugo. It offers a clean, minimal aesthetic that puts the focus on content without unnecessary distractions. Here‚Äôs why Blowfish stood out:\nEase of Customization: Blowfish is designed to be extremely developer-friendly. It‚Äôs easy to modify and extend, which allowed me to customize the layout to perfectly fit my portfolio‚Äôs needs. Responsive Design: The theme is fully responsive, ensuring that my site looks great across all devices. Content Management: With Hugo and Blowfish, managing blog posts is as simple as writing Markdown files and placing them in the correct directory. No more messing around with Vue components or GraphQL queries like I had to with Gridsome. For detailed instructions on installing and configuring the Blowfish theme, check out the official documentation: Blowfish Installation Guide.\nFinal Thoughts # Switching from Gridsome to Hugo has been a game-changer for my portfolio. It‚Äôs faster, simpler to maintain, and offers an easy-to-use content management system that fits my workflow perfectly.\nThe Blowfish theme, in particular, has made creating a stylish, professional portfolio and blog incredibly easy. If you‚Äôre looking to streamline your site, I highly recommend checking out Hugo and Blowfish.\nI‚Äôm excited to continue expanding my portfolio and sharing more content without the overhead of maintaining complex setups.

These steps include:\nCase Folding: This stage converts all characters in the text to lowercase and removes punctuation marks, ensuring uniformity in the text processing.\nTokenization: The text is broken down into smaller parts known as tokens or words, which are then individually processed.\nStopword Removal: Commonly used words that do not contribute significant meaning to the search, such as prepositions and conjunctions, are removed to focus on the most relevant terms.\nStemming: Words are reduced to their root form according to the morphological structure of the Indonesian language. This involves removing all affixes, such as prefixes, infixes, suffixes, and confixes, ensuring that the search considers the base meaning of the words.\nSimilarity Measurements\nLexical Similarity Measurement: The app uses Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and Cosine Similarity to measure lexical similarity. TF-IDF evaluates the importance of a word in a document relative to the entire dataset, while Cosine Similarity calculates the cosine of the angle between two vectors (representing documents or queries) to determine their similarity based on word occurrence.\nSemantic Similarity Measurement: To capture semantic meaning, the app employs word embeddings using the FastText model. This approach allows the app to understand and measure the similarity in meaning between words, even if they are not lexically identical, by representing words in a continuous vector space.\nScreenshots # Mobile App # Web App # API Documentation # Preview # Mobile App # Web App # App Features: # Advanced Qur\u0026rsquo;anic Text Search # The app allows users to search for Qur\u0026rsquo;anic verses in Indonesian translations using both lexical and semantic similarity, helping users find the most relevant verses based on keywords or meaning.\nLexical Search # The app features a search capability that leverages lexical similarity, ensuring that verses with similar keywords are accurately identified and presented to the user.\nSemantic Search # The search feature goes beyond keyword matching by understanding semantic meaning, enabling deeper and more relevant searches.\nIntegrated REST API # The app is integrated with a REST API developed using FastAPI Ayatnesia for managing Qur\u0026rsquo;anic data, ensuring fast and efficient search performance.\nReliable Data Source # Utilizing the Qur\u0026rsquo;an dataset from the Indonesian Ministry of Religious Affairs (Kemenag), including Arabic text, Indonesian translations, and brief interpretations, guarantees data accuracy and reliability.\nLink to Project # Mobile App # utrodus/flutter-ayatnesia-quran-search Mobile app developed using Flutter as a final year project for the Computer Science program at Nahdlatul Ulama University of Blitar.
